# gdriveopener

This app allows you to add google drive directory by passing its ID or link.

Directories are displayed on the main page as a list.

Each directory has a button that allows you to start the opening process.

When the button is clicked, the application goes though the files in the folder and its subfolders and opens the google doc and google sheet files in those apps on the phone. Delay between each file opening is 3 seconds.


This app skips the google doc files if there is no app for that.

This app skips the google sheeet files if there is no app for that.
